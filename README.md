Josephus Problem Implementations in C++ and HTML
This repository contains two implementations of the Josephus Problem, a famous theoretical problem in mathematics and computer science, in both C++ and HTML. These implementations provide different ways to explore and understand the problem.

C++ Implementation
Description
The C++ implementation of the Josephus Problem focuses on solving the problem programmatically. It allows you to calculate the position of the last person remaining after the elimination process, given the number of participants (n) and the elimination step (k).

How to Use (C++)
Compile the josephus.cpp file using your preferred C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable in your terminal or command prompt.
Enter the number of participants (n) and the elimination step (k) as prompted.
The program will calculate and display the position of the last person remaining.
C++ Implementation Files
josephus.cpp: The C++ source code for solving the Josephus Problem.
HTML Implementation
Description
The HTML implementation of the Josephus Problem is an interactive web-based application. It provides a visual representation of the problem and allows you to customize the number of participants (n) and the elimination step (k). By clicking the "Start" button, you can observe the elimination process and determine the position of the last person remaining.

How to Use (HTML)
Open the index.html file in a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
Customize the parameters by entering the number of participants (n) and the elimination step (k).
Click the "Start" button to initiate the animation.
Observe how participants are eliminated in the circle.
The position of the last person remaining will be displayed as the result.
HTML Implementation Files
index.html: The HTML file for the Josephus Problem interactive animation.
style.css: The CSS stylesheet for styling the HTML interface.
script.js: The JavaScript code responsible for the animation and problem solving.
Problem Description
The Josephus Problem is a theoretical problem that goes as follows:

Suppose there are n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n. Starting from person 1, you count around the circle and eliminate every k-th person until only one person remains. Both implementations in this repository aim to solve this problem.
